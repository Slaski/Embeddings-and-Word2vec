# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations

## Embeddings and Word2vec

This is a project on word embeddings and word2vec from the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations course from Udacity.
Embeddings improves the ability of networks to learn from data with a huge numbers of classes by representing the data with lower dimensional vectors.
Word embeddings allow the network to learn semantic relationships between words.

## Installation Requirements

The project requires the following frameworks and libraries:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* tqdm
* tensorflow 1.0
